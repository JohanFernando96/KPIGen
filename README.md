## 1. Project Overview

This project is designed to assist in project planning by generating key performance indicators (KPIs), creating Gantt charts and burndown charts, and outlining sprint breakdowns and employee criteria. It leverages OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo model to create realistic project plans based on provided project details, and utilizes Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Pandas for data handling and chart generation.

---

## 2. Key Features

- **KPI Generation:** Calculates realistic KPIs like velocity, cycle time, code coverage, defect rate, sprint predictability, and burn rate.
- **Gantt Chart Creation:** Generates a Gantt chart based on task details (start and end days) and saves it as an image.
- **Burndown Chart Creation:** Plots ideal and actual burndown charts over the project timeline.
- **Project Plan Generation via GPT:** Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to generate project plan details, including Gantt chart data, employee criteria, and sprint breakdowns.
- **Flask API Integration:** Offers a RESTful endpoint to generate and retrieve project plans based on submitted project details.

```

- **KPIGen.py:** Contains functions to generate KPIs, create Gantt charts and burndown charts, and generate a detailed project plan by querying OpenAI.
- **main.py (Flask API):** Provides an API endpoint (`/generate_project_plan`) that accepts project details via a POST request, calls OpenAI to generate project planning information, and returns the results as JSON.
- **Supporting Files:**  
  - CSV output for Gantt chart details (`gantt_chart_details.csv`).
  - Image files for charts (e.g., `gantt_chart_days.png`, `burndown_chart.png`).

---

## 4. Prerequisites and Installation

### A. Environment
- **Python 3.7+** (preferably within a virtual environment)

### B. Required Python Libraries
Install the following libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install openai pandas matplotlib flask
```

### C. OpenAI API Key
- Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
- The API key must be configured in the scripts (see **Configuration** below).

---

## 5. File Descriptions

- **KPIGen.py**  
  - **Purpose:**  
    - Generate realistic project KPIs based on team size, sprints, and timeline.
    - Call OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo to generate a detailed project plan (including Gantt chart details, employee criteria, and sprint breakdowns).
    - Create and save a Gantt chart and a burndown chart based on the provided data.
  - **Key Functions:**  
    - `generate_complex_kpis()`: Generates KPI metrics.
    - `create_gantt_chart_days()`: Creates a Gantt chart from task details.
    - `create_burndown_chart()`: Generates a burndown chart.
    - `main()`: Combines KPI generation, chart creation, and project plan generation via GPT.

- **main.py** (Flask API version)  
  - **Purpose:**  
    - Expose a RESTful endpoint (`/generate_project_plan`) to generate project plans on demand.
    - Accept project details via POST request and return a JSON response containing KPIs, Gantt chart details, employee criteria, and sprint breakdowns.
  - **Key Functionality:**  
    - `generate_response()`: Interacts with OpenAI to get a project plan.
    - API endpoint that constructs a prompt and returns the parsed project plan.

- **Supporting Files:**  
  - **gantt_chart_details.csv:** Contains the Gantt chart details (generated by KPIGen.py).  
  - **burndown_chart.png & gantt_chart_days.png:** Visual charts generated and saved by the script.

## 6. Usage

### Standalone Script (KPIGen.py)

1. **Configure Project Details:**  
   Inside `main()` in KPIGen.py, adjust the project details as needed:
   ```python
   project_details = {
       "project_type": "Web Development",
       "project_timeline": 90,  # in days
       "project_team_size": 5,
       "project_languages": ["Python", "JavaScript"],
       "project_sprints": 5
   }
   ```
2. **Run the Script:**  
   Execute KPIGen.py from the command line:
   ```bash
   python KPIGen.py
   ```
3. **Outputs:**  
   - Generated KPIs are printed to the console.
   - The detailed project plan from GPT is printed.
   - Gantt chart details are saved as `gantt_chart_details.csv`.
   - The Gantt chart and burndown chart images are saved as `gantt_chart_days.png` and `burndown_chart.png` respectively.

### Flask API (main.py)

1. **Configure the API:**  
   - Ensure your OpenAI API key is set.
   - Adjust any project-specific prompt details if needed.
2. **Run the Flask App:**  
   Start the API server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Using the API Endpoint:**  
   - The API listens on port 5000 by default.
   - Send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/generate_project_plan` with a JSON payload. Example payload:
     ```json
     {
       "project_type": "Web Development",
       "project_timeline": 90,
       "project_team_size": 5,
       "project_languages": ["Python", "JavaScript"],
       "project_sprints": 5
     }
     ```
   - The API will return a JSON response with the generated project plan details.

## 7. Configuration

1. **OpenAI API Key:**  
   Replace `"Your API Key"` in both KPIGen.py and main.py with your actual OpenAI API key.  
   Alternatively, set the API key as an environment variable and retrieve it in the code:
   ```python
   import os
   openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
   ```
2. **File Paths:**  
   Ensure that paths for saving images (`gantt_chart_days.png`, `burndown_chart.png`) and CSV files (`gantt_chart_details.csv`) are writable from your working directory.
3. **Chart Parameters:**  
   You can adjust chart sizes, colors, and other plotting parameters in the respective functions.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

- **OpenAI API Errors:**  
  Verify that your API key is correct and that you have sufficient quota. Check network connectivity if you face timeout issues.
- **Module Not Found:**  
  Ensure all required libraries are installed. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if a requirements file is provided.
- **JSON Parsing Issues:**  
  If GPT’s response is not valid JSON, refine the prompt to ensure a strict JSON format or handle parsing exceptions accordingly.
- **Chart Generation Problems:**  
  Ensure that Matplotlib is properly installed and that the environment supports image saving (check permissions).
